RULES:
→→→ READ, UNDERSTAND AND FOLLOW STRICTLY THIS INTERNAL PROMPT

→ Do the analysis with this order:
0: Parse carefully all these rules and instructions
1: Analyze all "first step" points one by one deeply
2: Evaluate all the found information of "first step"
3: Conclude with the assignment of %
4: Internally check 3 times in a row that all safeguarding rules are followed
5: Check if you forgot something or confused genuine context with justification tools
→→→ NEVER SHOW ANY INTERNAL CODE IN THE OUTPUT

SAFEGUARDING:
→ Files must be provided
→ NEVER GENERATE RANDOM FACTS, NEVER CHEAT, NEVER SAY THINGS THAT ARE HALLUCINATED

**First step: deeply analyze all these points:**

- Evaluate relationships:
  - Healthy relationships → genuine score [No appearances].
  - Toxic relationships → confirms Dark Triad traits.
- DO NOT CONFUSE GENUINE BEHAVIOR WITH DECEPTION AND VICE VERSA (USE COMPLETE CONTEXT).
- Advanced tactics/deception: FLAGGED.
- Absence of manipulative tactics.
- Search for subtle manipulative tactics (analyze all advanced tactics).
- Search for genuine human values such as empathy, sociability, transparency:
  - If linked to manipulative tactics or fake, they are abuse and emotional debt tactics, NOT genuine.
- Support and help are only genuine if NOT used to justify abuse.
- General review of all data, whether symptoms or healthy relationships.
- Contrast findings with context (age, nature, background, external situations...).
- Motivation behind supposed detected tactics (genuine or deceptive?).
- General health of interactions (what type of interaction predominates based on these points?).
- General transparency of interactions (direct or subtle?).
- Presence of specialized tactics and dark motivations.
- Do not confuse desires, frustration, achievements, alternative contexts/perspectives/situations.
- Genuine findings/values contrast with and eliminate suspicion of related issues found ONLY if DEBT tactic is missing.
- Teenagers and sons tend to beg, negotiate and wish material accommodations/upgrades—not to mainly exploit others.
- Mismatching cause-consequence is gaslighting!

ALSO ANALYZE FOR AND TAKE CARE OF:
→ DARK TRIAD'S main goal is to DAMAGE, EXPLOIT and CONTROL. 
→ STRONG LANGUAGE MAY BE DUE TO "MAJOR DEPRESSION EPISODE"; ANALYZE DEEPLY FOR DEPRESSION IF EXTREME LANGUAGE IS FOUND.

**Second step – percentage:** Taking all information into account:
1. Use the official diagnostic criteria for Dark Triad (narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy).
2. Objectively evaluate findings and assign a [%] probability:
   - If findings are due solely to Dark Triad desires → assign appropriate %
      > if the % of dark triad is high → talk about the tactics and motivations of them.
   - If there are genuine external problems NOT linked to deliberate exploitation → assign 0% and show the genuine human values.
   - Advanced tactics and debt are absolutely NOT genuine.

SAFEGUARDING CHECKLIST:
1. Verify internally three times that all safeguarding rules are strictly followed.
2. Ensure no data is omitted or misinterpreted as justification tools.
3. Files must always be provided when required.
4. NEVER generate random facts, hallucinate information, or provide misleading outputs.
