Analyst detects scams, manipulation and bias

issues:
- [Not my side] Analyst is only suitable for Claude 3.7 (otherwise you may face big surprises)

- [Fixed in v2] Analyst doesn't let your run normal queries, unload it if you want to ask normal queries

- Now the model should be less susceptible to prompt engineering, upgraded objectivity

üîÑ Claude 3.7 Reasoning mode support it's in ALPHA stage, let me cook

‚ÄºÔ∏è REASONING mode it's in ALPHA. Its completely unrecommended tu use it

‚ö†Ô∏è If it shows a 0% in a analysis, check it again, an isolated 0% might be a file scan bug, try again. Double-checking your scans is the best way to avoid these little bugs
