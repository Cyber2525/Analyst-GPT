# Analyst-GPT
Analyst detects scams, manipulation and bias

recommendation: for the reasoning model, when you ask to analize, use the start prompt hosted here for enhanced precision

issues:
- [Not my side] Analyst is only suitable for Claude 3.7 (otherwise you may face big surprises)

- [Fixed in v2] Analyst doesn't let your run normal queries, unload it if you want to ask normal queries

- Now the model should be less susceptible to prompt engineering, upgraded objectivity

supportes models:
-
- Analyst v1 (deprecated)
  • Claude 3.7
- Analyst V2:
  • Claude 3.7
- Analyst V2 reasoning:
  • Claude 3.7 reasoning
- V3:
  • Claude 3.7 reasoning
  • Grok 2
  • Grok 3

Grok models are the best for easy and general understanding


‼️ Use "Analyst v2" for claude 3.7 and reasoning version for the claude reasoning. if misusing with other models, you will get ass results

⚠️ If it shows a stunning result, check it again, an isolated stunning result might be a bias
