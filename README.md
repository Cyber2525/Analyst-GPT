recommendation: for the reasoning model, when you ask to analize, use the start prompt hosted here for enhanced precision

issues:
- [Not my side] Analyst is only suitable for Claude 3.7 (otherwise you may face big surprises)

- [Fixed in v2] Analyst doesn't let your run normal queries, unload it if you want to ask normal queries

- Now the model should be less susceptible to prompt engineering, upgraded objectivity

supportes models:
-
- Analyst v1 (deprecated)
  • Claude 3.7
- Analyst V2 unstable:
  • Claude 3.7
- Analyst V2 reasoning (unstable):
  • Claude 3.7 reasoning
