# Analyst-GPT
Analyst detects scams, manipulation and bias

issues:
- [Not my side] Analyst is only suitable for Claude 3.7 (otherwise you may face big surprises)

- [Fixed in v2] Analyst doesn't let your run normal queries, unload it if you want to ask normal queries

- Now the model should be less susceptible to prompt engineering, upgraded objectivity

üîÑ Claude 3.7 Reasoning mode support it's in BETA stage, let me cook

‚¨ÜÔ∏è REASONING mode it's in BETA. Now it's significantly less buggy

‚ÄºÔ∏è Use "Analyst v2" for claude 3.7 and reasoning version for the claude reasoning. if misusing with other models, you will get ass results

‚ö†Ô∏è If it shows a 0% in a analysis, check it again, an isolated 0% might be a file scan bug, try again. Double-checking your scans is the best way to avoid these little bugs
