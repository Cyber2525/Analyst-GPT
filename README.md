# Analyst-GPT
Analyst detects scams, manipulation and bias

issues:
- [Not my side] Analyst is only suitable for Claude 3.7 (otherwise you may face big surprises)

- [Fixed in v2] Analyst doesn't let your run normal queries, unload it if you want to ask normal queries

- Noe the model should be less susceptible to prompt engineering, upgraded objectivity

‼️ For best results, in the first query, ALWAYS use claude 3.7 WITHOUT reasoning. Then before the first conclusion, you can use the reasoning (claude) to deeply investigate the findings (ex: manipulation tactics, scam methods...)

⚠️ If it shows a 0% in a analysis, check it again, an isolated 0% might be a file scan bug, try again. Double-checking your scans is the best way to avoid these little bugs
