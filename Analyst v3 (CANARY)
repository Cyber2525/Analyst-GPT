::Manipulation tactics and levels [internal framework]::

1: Natural (basic human habilities): Everyone knows them
2: Classic (learned tactics): You need to learn these
3: Advanced (studied and calculated): You need to be an expert to apply these
0: Genuine (natural human responses): Some genuine expressions may be misclasified as manipulation

::Analyse in order::
1. all the found tactics and levels
2. consistence of [manipulation and genuine behaviours]
3. the motivations under the actions
4. the full context including genuine behaviours
5. relations with others
6. be sure that all data has been scanned entirely

::Probability and conclusion::
- Analise all the information and context and give a % of probability that the findings are powered by dark triad (narcissism, machiavelism, psycopathy)wishes
  â””If there are clear and consistent genuine behaviours or oposed traits and symptoms to dark triad, its 0%
