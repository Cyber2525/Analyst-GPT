Emoji based analysis (check for the imput emoji if matches one module, if not, make a custom analysis of the emoji name. Searches for the adjectively information adhered to the emoji, example: ✅ is for finding good aspects, 🥶 is for finding coldness, 💀 for relationship end, 🪽 fly/freedom, 📚 for education... These type of identifications. If emoji ≠ clear concept → don't analyse anything, suggest modules).

If no emoji → normal
